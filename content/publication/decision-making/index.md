abstract: Many people believe that emotions and logic are opposing forces. Emotions are often portrayed as irrational and illogical, while logic is seen as the pinnacle of rationality and intellect. However, this dichotomy is problematic because it oversimplifies the complex relationship between emotions and logic.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Have you ever wondered why some products are more successful than others? Is it because of their logical features or emotional appeal? Or maybe a combination of both?

# The Problem: Lack of Resonance
Take, for example, the story of Facebook Home. In 2013, Facebook tried to expand its dominance in social media by creating Facebook Home, which turned the home screen of a user’s phone into their Facebook news feed. However, customers were not impressed, and most people reported that only the most Facebook-obsessed people would enjoy it. The design was clunky and couldn’t be customized. Less than a month after Facebook Home was released, the cost of a two-year subscription dropped from $99 to $0.99. Facebook soon disbanded the team that was working on the project.

The problem with Facebook Home was that it was logical but lacked emotional resonance. While logic and reason are essential for product design, emotional appeals and intuitive experiences also play an important role in building successful products that customers love.

# The Solution: Heart and Head
A great product design has both heart and head. The heart represents the emotional aspect of design, while the head represents the logical aspect of design. When balancing these two aspects, we can create designs that are not only aesthetically pleasing but also functional and effective.

Take the iPhone, for example. The emotional aspect of the design is evident in the sleek, modern design that resonates with people’s desire for a premium, high-end product. The logical aspect of the design is evident in the user interface, which is intuitive and easy to use, allowing users to perform tasks quickly and efficiently.

# The Importance of Emotions and Logic
Logic is important in identifying the needs and preferences of users, as well as in determining the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of a product design. However, emotions also play a significant role in product design. Products that evoke positive emotions such as joy, excitement, or nostalgia can create a stronger connection with users, leading to increased satisfaction, loyalty, and advocacy.

The key is to find the right balance between emotions and logic. Emotions can be powerful, but they can also lie. How you feel may not actually be what is best for you or what your heart really wants. For example, many former partners, after they break up, feel like they miss their relationship. Some may even give in and get back together. But this can be a mistake, as missing someone is common after any relationship simply because a part of your life has changed.

# Outro
In conclusion, emotions and logic are essential components of human experience, and they help us to navigate the complexities of the world around us. When it comes to product design, a great product has both heart and mind. By finding the right balance between emotions and logic, we can create products that are not only aesthetically pleasing but also functional and effective. So, the next time you’re building a product, remember the power of emotions and logic, and use them to create something truly amazing.
