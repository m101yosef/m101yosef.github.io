	abstract = {Reinforcement Learning, learning through trial and error, is a rapidly growing field in AI. 
	Unlike supervised learning, reinforcement learning provides you with the ability to learn directly from the 
	world and adapt to new situations which makes it a valuable option for complex, real-world problems. 
	From AlphaGo beating the world champion in Go, to the newest updates on large language models and what they can do, 
	RL algorithms with no doubt have a huge impact in the present and the future of automation and Human-AI interaction. 
	With this collection of RL principles, you will gain a deeper understand of how RL work and you may gain insights 
	applicable in your own work, leading to innovative solutions.},
