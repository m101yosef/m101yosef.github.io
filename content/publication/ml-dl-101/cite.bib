	abstract = {Exploring machine learning paradigms and the core idea behind it which is generalization. 
	Also, I talked about neural networks and how deep learning is different from traditional machine learning as well as 
	how to use activations functions and optimizers. At the end, I added a small overview of model evaluation followed by some 
	of the common types of neural networks architectures nowadays like CNNs, RNNs, and Transformers.},
