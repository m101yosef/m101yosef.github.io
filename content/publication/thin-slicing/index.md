abstract: Thin slicing refers to the skill of filtering huge amounts of data and experiences stored in our brains and zeroing in on the few critical details that provide useful insight. Our thin-slicing abilities allow us to perceive vast amounts of information almost instantaneously. Without consciously realizing it, we pick up on numerous details such as facial expressions, vocal tones, and body language that allow us to make judgments within seconds of meeting someone. According to Gladwell, the essential components of thin-slicing are pattern recognition, subtle cues, and the unconscious mind. We are constantly subconsciously observing these patterns around us and filing them away in our memories and associative networks. When a new situation arises, these past experiences allow our instinctive minds to connect the dots and identify the most relevant patterns within seconds.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Making decisions quickly and intuitively comes naturally to humans. But how exactly does this “flash reasoning” work? In his book “Blink,” Malcolm Gladwell explores the concept of thin-slicing — our ability to make accurate judgments and decisions based on very limited information.

# Gottman experiment
A young couple, Bill and Susan, visited psychologist John Gottman. Gottman **recorded a 15 minute conversation between Bill and Susan where they discussed dogs**. To an outside observer, the conversation seemed normal and unremarkable.

However, Gottman’s research showed that by analysing things like facial expressions, perspiration, heart rate and patterns of interaction, **he could predict with 90% accuracy whether a couple would still be married in 15 years based on just 15 minutes of observation.**

In Bill and Susan’s conversation, Gottman noticed signs that indicated problems in their relationship.

- Bill used a **“yes, but”** conversational strategy,
- Susan **rolled her eyes** several times,
- She **didn’t give Bill positive reinforcement** when he talked about taking care of their dog.

These subtle behaviours revealed tensions and lack of connection between Bill and Susan, suggesting to Gottman that **they would likely divorce in the future**.

Despite seeming ordinary, their short conversation contained “thin slices” of information that an experienced observer like Gottman could interpret accurately.

# Who wants to be Sherlock Holmes?

In the world of Sherlock Holmes, thin slicing was a critical tool for solving crimes. Holmes would **observe small details**, such as **the way a person walked or the pattern of wear on their clothing**, and use that information to make inferences about their personality, habits, and recent activities.

For example, in “A Study in Scarlet,” the first Sherlock Holmes novel, **Holmes deduces that a man is a drunkard by observing the way his left sleeve is worn**, indicating that he frequently rests it on a bar counter while drinking.

In “The Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle,” Holmes is able to **deduce that a man was a goose farmer by observing a small, unique feather on his hat**.

Holmes also used thin slicing in his interactions with people. He would observe their body language, tone of voice, and word choice, and use that information to make judgments about their character and motivations.

In “The Adventure of the Speckled Band,” Holmes is able to **tell that a stepfather is lying** about his whereabouts on the night of his stepdaughter’s death **by observing the way he avoids eye contact and fidgets with his hands**.

# **Thin Slicing in the medical field**

Thin slicing, or making judgements from limited information, can be seen in the field of medical malpractice insurance.

**Doctors who are less likely to be sued tend to:**

- Speak to patients for longer periods of time
- Make more “orienting statements” to patients
- Use certain speech patterns

Just a few seconds of observing how a doctor speaks to patients can predict if that doctor will be sued for malpractice. However, doctors who get sued are not necessarily worse doctors. A doctor who establishes rapport with patients is less likely to anger them and face a lawsuit.

# **Professionals also value Thin Slicing**

Many occupations value and recognize the ability to make good judgments based on limited information, or thin slicing.

For example, in the French military, **generals** are expected to have “the power of the glance.” This means they should be able to **determine the right strategic approach just from briefly observing the battlefield**.

In Hollywood, producer Brian Grazer claims he instantly “knew” that Tom Hanks would become a huge movie star **after meeting him for only a few seconds**.

The ability to thin slice — to draw big conclusions from little information — is seen as a sign of expertise in fields as diverse as the military, medicine and entertainment.

Professionals in these occupations are expected to be able to perceive the most useful patterns from just a brief glance or moment of observation.

# **How to apply thin slicing in your daily life**

1. **In social situations**: When meeting someone new, pay attention to their body language, tone of voice, and facial expressions. These can give you important clues about their personality, intentions, and emotions.
2. **In hiring**: When interviewing job candidates, pay attention to how they present themselves, the tone and content of their responses, and their body language. These can help you make more accurate judgments about their fit for the position.
3. **In decision-making**: When faced with a complex decision, break it down into smaller, more manageable parts. Make quick judgments about each part based on limited information, and then use those judgments to inform your overall decision.
4. **In dating**: When going on a first date, pay attention to your date’s behaviour, conversation, and body language. This can help you get a sense of their personality and whether or not you might be compatible.
5. **In negotiations**: When negotiating with someone, pay attention to their tone of voice, body language, and word choice. These can give you important clues about their intentions and how they might be willing to compromise.
