# **1. Introducing lifestyle**

In recent years, the concept of lifestyle has become an integral part of any brand. Introducing lifestyle can change how customers interact with a product since it gives them an idea of how it can be incorporated into their lifestyle.

The inclusion of lifestyle in products adds more depth and personality to the product, making it more relatable and engaging for potential customers, and has SEO benefits. This information allows shoppers to visualize how the product could be used in their daily routine or special occasions, which makes the purchase decision more personal and meaningful.

With the rise of smartphones and mobile devices, customers tend to skim through product details quickly. By incorporating lifestyle information, product designers and marketers can provide more eye-catching details that entice customers to read the full description, increasing engagement and dwell time on the product page.

Finally, customers can feel more confident when purchasing a product with lifestyle information since they have a better idea of how it will fit into their life. A study by Motista revealed that customers who have an emotional connection with a brand have [a 306% higher customer lifetime value (CLV)](https://martechseries.com/sales-marketing/customer-experience-management/motistas-study-results-conclude-emotional-connection-key-brand-success/). This can lead to a decrease in returns and an increase in customer satisfaction.

As online shopping continues to soar in popularity, it is important to ensure that customers receive a true representation of the products they are buying. One way to achieve this is by taking shots of the product from all relevant angles. Given that [22% of shoppers return products because they look different in real life compared to the photos](https://www.ecwid.com/blog/ecommerce-for-beginners-product-photography-mistakes.html).

By providing multiple photos of the product, customers can get a better understanding of its shape, size, and texture. For example, if a customer is interested in purchasing a piece of clothing, shots from the front, back, and side can help them determine how the garment fits and looks from all angles. Similarly, if a customer is considering buying a piece of furniture, shots of the product from different angles can allow them to see the item’s details and dimensions.

Furthermore, if a product comes in various colors, it is crucial to provide pictures of each color variation. This allows customers to visualize how their preferred color will look in real life and helps them make a clear decision on the product they want to purchase.

In conclusion, including shots from all relevant angles and showcasing product variations in different colors is an effective way to give customers a more accurate representation of the product they are interested in. This approach enhances their online shopping experience, increases their confidence in the product, and ultimately leads to greater customer satisfaction.

# **3. Shipping details**

Providing clear and detailed shipping information is crucial for the success of any e-commerce business. Baymard [studies reveal](https://baymard.com/blog/show-shipping-costs-on-product-pages) that 64% of users look for information about shipping costs on the product page immediately, while 24% of them claim to have skipped a purchase because they couldn’t find them.

This highlights the importance of displaying shipping details prominently on the website. Customers want to know how much they are going to pay for shipping and how long it will take for their order to arrive. Providing this information upfront can help build trust with customers and improve their overall shopping experience.

In addition, shipping information should be accurate and up-to-date. Customers should be able to track their orders easily and receive notifications when their package is in transit or delivered. Offering flexible shipping options such as express shipping or free shipping for orders over a certain amount can also attract more customers to the website.

Failing to provide clear and accurate shipping information can result in lower customer satisfaction, increased cart abandonment, and ultimately, lost sales. By prioritizing shipping details and making sure they are easily accessible, e-commerce businesses can increase customer trust and loyalty, and ultimately, drive revenue growth.

# **4. Product reviews**

Product reviews have become an essential part of e-commerce business these days. For both the customers and the businesses, the benefits of product reviews are significant. [87% of consumers place as much trust in a product review as they would word-to-mouth](https://www.readycloud.com/info/21-statistics-about-product-reviews-4-convincing-reasons-why-your-store-needs-them). This trust translates into conversions. Also, [online product reviews yield an average sales uplift of 18%](https://www.readycloud.com/info/21-statistics-about-product-reviews-4-convincing-reasons-why-your-store-needs-them).

One of the primary benefits of product reviews for e-commerce businesses is that they help in improving the quality of their products. By reading customer reviews, businesses can identify their strengths and weaknesses and make necessary changes to their products. Positive reviews also help in building brand reputation and increasing sales. When customers see positive reviews, they are more likely to purchase products from that brand.

Product reviews also help in improving the overall customer experience. If a customer is considering purchasing a product but is unsure about its quality or performance, reading other customer reviews can help them make an informed decision. It saves customers time and money by enabling them to choose products that meet their needs and expectations.

Moreover, the feedback provided by customers through product reviews assists businesses in identifying areas where they can improve customer service. This feedback can be used to address customer complaints, answer their queries, and offer better support. This, in turn, helps in building customer loyalty and trust.

In conclusion, product reviews help businesses to improve the quality of their products and services and build brand reputation, while customers benefit from making informed decisions and having better overall experiences.

# **5. Syncing across devices**
