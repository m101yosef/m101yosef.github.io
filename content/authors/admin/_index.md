My name is Mohamed Yosef, a data scientist and AI researcher from Egypt. I started as a user experience (UX) designer (2021-2023), making apps and websites easy and enjoyable to use. My passion for design and creative thinking helps me a lot in my current work in data science, specifically  **deep reinforcement learning** (deep RL), a machine learning approach that helps systems make decisions by trying different actions and learning from the results. I also study **human-AI interaction**, which is about exploring how people and AI systems can effectively collaborate and enhance each other's capabilities. 

At Mansoura University, I lead a project called **AQSA** (Sep 2023 - May 2024) aimed at using the new AI techniques to help small businesses as well as bridging the gap between research and real-world applications. The project consists of three key components: Generative Chatbot (tailored for information about startup ecosystem and other parts of AQSA), Automated Data Analysis (get visual representation of any given data), and Forecasting module (combining historical data, market trends, and external factors like currency exchange rates and oil prices to generate reliable predictions for sales or interest rates).

While I don't design for businesses anymore, my love for art and creativity remains a strong personal passion. I still design the figures for my research papers and articles. The reason behind that is it feels special -- having complete control over the visual representation of my story -- which allows me to craft a clearer, more impactful work.
