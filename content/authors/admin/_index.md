## The Intersection of Operations and AI

My work focuses on bridging the gap between complex technical requirements and clear, seamless delivery. I am currently the **Technical Program Manager** at **Khalas-ha Sah**, where I oversee the execution of digital services, ensuring that every project is delivered accurately and professionally. I position myself as the "organised mind" that ensures work is done right the first time.

My technical background is rooted in **Applied Data Science** and **Machine Learning Engineering**. I have practical experience deploying NLP models and scalable REST APIs for organisations like **IEEE** and **Meter we Nos**, where I built systems ranging from event recommendation engines to legal-tech chatbots.

In 2024, I led the Data & AI module for the AQSA Project at Mansoura University, developing forecasting systems and analytical tools for small businesses. While I maintain a strong interest in the theoretical foundations of machine learning and computational neuroscience, my professional priority is applying these technical skills to create reliable, transparent systems for business operations.

I am driven by accuracy, responsibility, and the belief that professional services should be seamless.
