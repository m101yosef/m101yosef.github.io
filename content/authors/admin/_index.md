### Data, ML & Inference 
At the intersection of machine learning models and inference, you will find me. My background in statistics and product design shapes my approach to machine learning and large language models as systems that must run reliably in production not as isolated models. 

I love doing data science experimentation and that is why I use experimentation as the first step in moving the ideas to deployed products. My process includes going through research, design, development, deployment, monitoring, and iterating... (Yes, the process never ends, it's a continuous loop of iterations). This was the core philosophy behind my work on previous projects like AQSA & EVNTO and continues now in my role as Machine Learning Engineer at ERTAQY.

At the end of the day, machine learning and data are one part of a wider software ecosystem, not the centre of it. For that reason, I prioritise clarity, reproducibility, and system health over short-term performance gains or academic novelty.
