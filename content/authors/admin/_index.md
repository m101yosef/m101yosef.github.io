## Okay, here is what I'm doing and why...

AI has the potential to support better decisions, uncover hidden patterns, and create tools that make people’s lives easier. My work focuses on applying machine learning to real-world problems — particularly in areas like small business performance, forecasting, and, increasingly, healthcare and neuroscience.

I'm currently focused on applying data science and machine learning in these domains because I believe this is where AI can do the most good — and where I know my work won’t go in vain or be used in the wrong way.

I’m an applied data scientist with a background in computer science and user experience design. My interest lies in building simple but useful systems that combine data, mathematical reasoning, and an understanding of human needs.

In 2024, I led the AQSA Project at Mansoura University, where we developed tools to help small businesses with automatic data analysis, time-series forecasting, and chatbot support. I also contributed to EVNTO!, a campus events platform that includes event recommendations, sentiment analysis, and a generative chatbot — helping students engage with volunteer work and campus life more easily.

Outside of hands-on projects, I publish research reviews and reflective pieces to sharpen my understanding and contribute to the learning community. I’m currently exploring deep reinforcement learning, with long-term curiosity about the brain and how AI might help us learn from — or connect more deeply with — human cognition.

My work is still in the early stages, and I’m constantly learning. But I’m driven by a clear question:
How can AI become a tool that genuinely helps people — not just impresses them?
