<br>

My passion for data and mathematics has fuelled a diverse career where I apply machine learning and AI to solve real-world problems.

I’ve collaborated with businesses to leverage AI for smarter decision-making, automate workflows, and create advanced chatbots. My experience spans building recommendation systems, time-series forecasting models, and applying AI across various industries. I’ve led research projects at the intersection of [economic trends](https://mohamedyosef101.github.io/publication/unempgrowth/), [energy consumption](https://mohamedyosef101.github.io/publication/global-energy/), and human performance, such as my recent analysis of the [2024 Olympics](https://mohamedyosef101.github.io/publication/olympics-economics/).

In addition to my freelance projects, I’ve developed apps like [AQSA](https://mohamedyosef101.github.io/publication/aqsa/) and [EVNTO](https://mohamedyosef101.github.io/publication/evnto/) for universities and startups, using AI to enhance user experiences. My work thrives in collaborative environments, and I’m always looking for innovative ways AI can transform industries and impact the future.

Currently, I’m focusing on mastering reinforcement learning, expanding my expertise in Natural Language Processing and Time Series Analysis, while exploring how AI can drive human-AI interaction and deeper insights into the brain.
