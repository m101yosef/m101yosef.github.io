My name is Mohamed Yosef, a data scientist and researcher from Egypt. I started out in user experience design, which means I worked on making apps and websites easy and enjoyable to use. After that, I got into **data science**, where I now focus on **deep reinforcement learning** (deep RL) and **time series analysis**.

**Deep RL** is a type of machine learning that helps machines make decisions by trying different actions and learning from the results. **Time series analysis** is when you look at data thatâ€™s collected over time to find trends or patterns. I also study **multi-agent learning**, which is about teaching multiple AI agents to work together and solve problems.

At Mansoura University, I lead a project called **AQSA** where we help small businesses by using time-series and RL techniques to analyze and forecaste their sales data. This helps them figure out the best ways to sell their products.

My main aim is to make AI agents helpful partners for people in their work and daily life. I believe that by combining my design skills with my knowledge of data, I can make AI agents that are not only smart but also easy and pleasant to use.
