I am Mohamed Yosef, a **Data Scientist, MLOps Engineer, and Reinforcement Learning (RL) Researcher** from Egypt. My journey began as a **UX designer (2021-2023)**, where I crafted intuitive digital experiences and learned how to design solutions that solve real-world problems. This background in design and creative thinking plays a crucial role in my current work, particularly in operationalizing AI systems and applying advanced techniques like **deep reinforcement learning (Deep RL)**—a field where systems learn to make decisions by exploring actions and learning from outcomes.

In addition to RL, I focus on **human-AI interaction**, studying how AI systems and humans can collaborate to enhance each other’s capabilities. My work bridges **research and practical applications**, ensuring that cutting-edge AI techniques don’t just remain theoretical but have real-world impact.

At **Mansoura University**, I lead the **AQSA project (Sep 2023 - May 2024)**, an initiative designed to help small businesses thrive by using AI to bridge the gap between research and practical, scalable applications. The AQSA project consists of three core components:
1. **Generative Chatbot**: Provides tailored information about the startup ecosystem.
2. **Automated Data Analysis**: Visualizes insights from any dataset to support decision-making.
3. **Forecasting Module**: Utilizes historical data, market trends, and factors like currency exchange rates to make accurate sales or interest predictions.

Currently, as an **MLOps Engineer**, I help businesses streamline the **deployment, monitoring, and scaling** of machine learning models in production environments. MLOps is essential for ensuring that models built in the development stage are **reliable, scalable, and deliver consistent results** in real-world applications. By focusing on **CI/CD pipelines**, **infrastructure management**, and **automation**, I ensure that AI systems perform effectively and adapt to evolving business needs.

In my role, I work across various sectors—from **e-commerce** and **finance** to **healthcare** and **logistics**—helping organizations improve their **decision-making processes**, **automate workflows**, and **gain real-time insights** through reliable AI systems. By integrating **machine learning and reinforcement learning** into their business processes, companies can not only improve efficiency but also reduce costs and remain competitive in an ever-evolving marketplace.
