My name is Mohamed Yosef, a data scientist and reinforcement learning researcher from Egypt. For me, science is not just knowledge - it's a way of thinking. After working as a UX designer from 2021-2023, I transitioned to data science work. 

My research now focuses on using deep reinforcement learning to enhance human-AI interaction and enable multi-agent learning. I'm also leading Project AQSA at Mansoura University to employ AI to help small businesses manage finances. I share my ideas and insights on reinforcement learning through [my Medium blog](https://medium.com/@mohamedyosef101). 

Combining design thinking and analytical rigor, I aim to push the boundaries of what's possible with AI. I'm passionate about developing AI that augments human capabilities and unlocks new possibilities.
