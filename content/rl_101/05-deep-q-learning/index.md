title: Deep Q-learning - Reinforcement Learning plus Neural Network.

# Summary for listings and search engines
summary: Unlike traditional Q-learning which can only work with small state spaces, deep Q-learning uses a neural network so it can work with very large state spaces

# Intro

From the name, you say that it’s a combination of [neural networks](https://www.kaggle.com/code/mohamedyosef101/get-into-deep-learning-with-pytorch-ann-cnn) and [reinforcement learning](https://medium.com/@mohamedyosef101/the-fundamentals-of-reinforcement-learning-explained-f42de0053fc7) and that’s true as a starting point. Going more in-depth, you’ll find out that the **neural network works as the agent’s perception system** which means the neural network is used to process the raw data from the environment and convert it into a representation that the agent can use to determine the optimal actions.

So, you can let the **neural network** **learn** the appropriate perception system **on its own [directly from the environment](https://medium.com/@mohamedyosef101/model-free-policy-learning-08d163338604)** rather than having to manually engineer feature representations.
