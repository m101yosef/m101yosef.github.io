The goal is not to memorise a catalogue of algorithms but to develop a strong intuition for computational complexity, data structures, and algorithmic paradigms. The course will consistently bridge theoretical concepts to their practical applications in the AI/ML domain, answering the question, "Why does this matter for a data scientist?"
