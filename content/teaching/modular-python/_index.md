If you know me at all, you will know that I always encourage thinking over having a knowledge but here I am creating a course on the most theoretical concepts in programming. Understanding modular coding will give you the ability to see what is behind the code; the thinking process that the code creator had. You will be able to see why they structured their code like this or even discover mistakes or ways of improvements.

Also, you should know that I admire learn by doing. In fact, I never understood OOP until I used it to build neural networks in PyTorch or dynamic programming until using it for reinforcement learning. So, with no doubt, there will be a lot of practical exercises in this course.
