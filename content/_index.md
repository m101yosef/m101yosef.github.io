       **Hi, Iâ€™m Mohamed, a data scientist specialising in machine learning and reinforcement learning.**

From time-series forecasting and predictive analytics to reinforcement-learning agents, I turn raw data into clear insights and actionable solutions. My work bridges rigorous analysis with hands-on implementation, helping businesses make smarter decisions, optimise processes and uncover patterns that drive growth.
