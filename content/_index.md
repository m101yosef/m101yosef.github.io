        **I Use Data Science to Explore the Unknown**

        <div><br></div>

        I'm curious about how data can help us understand our world better (more importantly: the human brain). 
        My research mainly focuses on deep reinforcement learning, human-AI interaction, and sometimes computational neuroscience.
